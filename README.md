## ⚙️ Project Steps

### **1. Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)**

* Imported CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
* Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types
* Standardized categorical columns (Gender, Season, etc.)

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Visualized customer demographics and spending trends
* Identified correlations between purchase amount, age, and subscription
* Found top-performing product categories and seasons

### **3. SQL Analysis**

* Connected cleaned dataset to a SQL database
* Executed analytical queries to extract insights:

  * Top categories by revenue
  * Average spending by gender and subscription status
  * Revenue comparison across seasons and payment methods

### **4. Power BI Dashboard**

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing key insights:

* Total Customers: **3.9K**
* Average Purchase Amount: **$59.76**
* Average Rating: **3.8**
* Revenue by Category, Season, and Payment Method
* Subscription Distribution

### **5. Report & Presentation**

* Created a concise **business report** summarizing findings
* Designed an **executive presentation in Gamma** to communicate insights and recommendations
